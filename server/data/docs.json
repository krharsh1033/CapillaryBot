  "API_Version": "Capillary's APIs are divided into four versions:\n\n- v1\n- v1.1\n- v2\n- v3\n\nThese versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of:\n- new sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and\n- upgraded versions of existing APIs.\n\nThe v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The v2 and v3 APIs are developed in JSON.\n\n**Additional features of v2 and v3 APIs:**\n- Provide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\n- Support multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\n- Merge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using their mobile number and on the e-commerce site using their email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\n\n*NOTE:* By default, all the API versions are enabled for the organisations across clusters.\n\n**Tracking Request:**\nA unique ID is generated for every request made using Capillary APIs and is sent to the requester in the Response Headers as `X-Cap-Requestid`. You can use this request ID to track the request end-to-end. It is recommended to note the `X-Cap-Requestid` of a request for future requirements.",
